VERY VERY WIP..

Intention is to run Gen1 on RP2040 with small touch display.

Initial testing platform is [Waveshare RP2040-Touch-LCD-1.28](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RP2040-Touch-LCD-1.28#Overview).

There's something very wrong with me.

Attempting in Micropython first, which sucks, but I'm literally too lazy to install the RP2040 C toolchain.
